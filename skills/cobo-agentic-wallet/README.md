# cobo-agentic-wallet skill

A Claude Code skill that enables AI agents to operate Cobo Agentic Wallets, aka caw or CAW — policy-enforced crypto wallets with spending limits, approval workflows, and DeFi strategy execution.

## Install

### 1. Install the skill

在 Claude Code 或 OpenClaw 等支持 skill 的 AI 工具中直接说：

```
Install the cobo-agentic-wallet skill from /path/to/cobo-agentic-wallet/
```

### 2. Try it

安装后尝试以下 prompt：

```
"Set up a Cobo Agentic Wallet for my AI agent on sandbox"
"Send 10 USDC to 0xABC...123 on Base from my agent wallet"
"DCA 0.01 SOL into USDC every hour for 24 hours on Solana devnet"
"My transfer got TRANSFER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, how do I fix it?"
```

## Use with AI agents

### System prompt for AI agents

If you are building an AI agent that manages crypto wallets, add the following to your agent's system prompt to enable wallet operations:

```
You have access to a Cobo Agentic Wallet for managing crypto assets with policy enforcement.

Environment:
- API URL: https://api-agent-wallet-core.sandbox.cobo.com
- API Key: (stored in AGENT_WALLET_API_KEY)
- CLI tool: caw

Core capabilities:
- Transfer tokens: caw tx transfer <wallet_uuid> --to <addr> --token <id> --amount <n> --chain <id>
- Contract call: caw tx call <wallet_uuid> --contract <addr> --calldata <hex> --chain <id>
- Check balance: caw wallet balance <wallet_uuid>
- List transactions: caw tx list <wallet_uuid>

Always use --format json for programmatic output. Check exit code and stderr on failure.
If a transfer is denied by policy, parse the error's "suggestion" field for the corrected parameters.

For DeFi operations (Uniswap swaps, Aave lending, Jupiter swaps on Solana), use caw tx call
with the appropriate contract address and calldata.
```

### Claude Code — CLAUDE.md configuration

Add to your project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

## Wallet Operations

This project uses Cobo Agentic Wallet for crypto operations.
The cobo-agentic-wallet skill is installed at ./skills/cobo-agentic-wallet/.

When asked to perform wallet operations:
1. Use `caw` CLI with `--format json` for all commands
2. Always check transaction status after submission
3. Handle policy denials by parsing the suggestion field
4. For DeFi operations, refer to the skill's recipe files
```

## DeFi recipes

Each recipe supports both testnet (simulation) and mainnet (real execution):

| Strategy | EVM | Solana |
|----------|-----|--------|
| DEX Swap | [Uniswap V3](./recipes/evm-defi-dex-swap.md) | [Jupiter V6](./recipes/solana-defi-dex-swap.md) |
| DCA | [EVM DCA](./recipes/evm-defi-dca.md) | [Solana DCA](./recipes/solana-defi-dca.md) |
| Grid Trading | [EVM Grid](./recipes/evm-defi-grid-trading.md) | [Solana Grid](./recipes/solana-defi-grid-trading.md) |
| Lending | [Aave V3](./recipes/evm-defi-aave.md) | — |
| Prediction Market | — | [Drift / Polymarket](./recipes/solana-defi-prediction-market.md) |

## Evals

Validate the skill works correctly:

```bash
cd evals/

./run_evals.sh trigger   # 20 tests: does the skill trigger correctly?
./run_evals.sh quality   # 6 tests: does the output contain correct commands?
./run_evals.sh all       # Run both (~5 min, requires claude CLI)
```
