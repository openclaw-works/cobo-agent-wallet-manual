# Pact Management

Execution authorization is implemented via the `caw pact` CLI commands. **When presenting this to the user, frame it as "requesting approval for this action" — do not expose internal terminology.**

**User-facing language:**
- Do say: "This action requires owner approval. I'm requesting authorization now."
- Do say: "Authorization approved — proceeding with the operation."
- Do say: "Authorization was rejected by the owner."
- Do say: "Waiting for the owner to approve this action."
- Do not say: "I need to create a pact for this operation."
- Do not say: "The pact is pending approval."
- Do not say: "Submitting a pact..."

## When to use execution authorization

**Decision principle**: Evaluate the full end-to-end complexity of the user's intent. If completing the task involves on-chain writes (contract calls, message signing), spans time (recurring, scheduled, multi-phase), requires coordinated multi-step execution, or carries financial risk beyond a simple one-shot transfer — request authorization. When in doubt, request authorization. Never suggest the user manually configure controls in WebConsole as a substitute for this flow.

**Authorization required:**
- Contract calls (`caw tx call`) or message signing (`caw tx sign-message`)
- Any task that spans time or repeats (recurring transfers, DCA, periodic rebalancing, scheduled automation)
- Multi-step workflows with risk bounds
- Temporary delegated access with explicit expiry
- Transfer denied due to cumulative quota exhaustion (daily/monthly limit reached)

**Direct execution (no authorization):**
- Single token transfer within default quota — try `caw tx transfer` first
- Read-only queries (`caw wallet balance`, `caw tx list`, etc.)
- Per-transaction limit denial — suggest reduced amount or ask user to contact owner

## Execution Authorization Flow

1. **Dedup check**: `caw --format json pact list --status pending_approval --wallet-id <id>`. If a pending request exists with the same intent, do NOT submit — inform the user and share the existing review link. If the user changed their intent, revoke the old one first (`caw --format json pact revoke <old_pact_id>`), then proceed.
2. **Construct** authorization parameters from the user's intent (see [Intent -> Submit Parameter Mapping](#intent---submit-parameter-mapping))
3. **Submit**: `caw --format json pact submit ...`
4. **Communicate**: Extract `approval_id` from the submit response, construct the review URL `https://agenticwallet.sandbox.cobo.com/dashboard?approval=<approval_id>`, and present it as a formatted link. Tell the user:

   > ✅ Authorization request submitted. The owner needs to approve it before I can proceed.
   >
   > 🔗 **[Review & Approve in CAW App](https://agenticwallet.sandbox.cobo.com/dashboard?approval=<approval_id>)**
5. **Track**: Run `caw track --watch &` in the background to receive terminal state notifications (`active`/`rejected`/`completed`/`expired`/`revoked`) delivered via `openclaw agent --deliver`. The `prompt` stored in `--context` controls what the receiving agent does.
6. **On `active`** *(delivered via [Notification])*: Proceed with execution using the authorization-scoped API key
7. **On `rejected`** *(delivered via [Notification])*: Tell the user "The owner declined this action." Suggest adjustments if applicable.

## Transfer Quota Exhaustion Fallback

When `caw tx transfer` is denied due to cumulative limit exhaustion (daily/monthly spending cap reached — NOT a per-transaction limit), automatically switch to the execution authorization flow:

1. Detect denial with cumulative limit reason (e.g., `rolling_24h`, `rolling_30d` in error response)
2. Inform the user: "The current spending limit has been reached. I'll request authorization for this transfer."
3. Submit an authorization request with `--permissions write:transfer,read:wallet`, scoped to this specific transfer
4. Wait for owner approval, then execute the transfer under the new authorization

> **Do not** trigger this fallback for per-transaction limit denials. For those, follow the standard [error handling flow](./error-handling.md) (suggest reduced amount or ask user to contact owner).

## Lifecycle

Common lifecycle states:
- `pending_approval`: submitted and waiting for owner decision; request enters `pending_approval` immediately after submit
- `active`: approved and activated; delegated execution can proceed
- terminal states: `rejected`, `completed`, `expired`, `cancelled`

Use `caw --format json pact get <pact_id>` to observe state transitions and current details.

## CLI Command Reference

### `caw pact submit`

Submit a new authorization request for owner approval. Creates a `PENDING_APPROVAL` request and sends a notification to the owner via CAW App.

**Required flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--wallet-id <uuid>` | Target wallet UUID |
| `--intent <text>` | Natural language description of the authorization's purpose |

**Optional flags (inline mode):**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--permissions <list>` | `operator` | Comma-separated permissions granted to the operator. Values: `operator`, `viewer`, `read:wallet`, `write:wallet`, `write:transfer`, `write:contract_call`, `write:manage`. Always choose the **minimum** set needed (see [Least Privilege](#least-privilege-principle)). |
| `--duration <seconds>` | `0` (no expiry) | Pact duration in seconds from activation. Prefer an explicit finite duration unless the user explicitly requests no expiry. |
| `--max-tx <usd>` | -- | Maximum USD value per transaction. Creates an inline transfer limit policy. This is a shortcut; for fine-grained policies use `--spec-file` / `--spec-json`. |
| `--name <text>` | derived from `--intent` | Human-readable name for owner review |
| `--resource-scope <json>` | -- | Resource scope constraints as JSON, e.g. `'{"wallet_id":"<uuid>"}'`. Always bind to the target wallet at minimum. |
| `--execution-plan <text>` | -- | Free-form execution plan in markdown format, shown to the owner during approval review. Use sections like `# Summary`, `# Contract Operations`, `# Risk Controls`, `# Schedule` to help the owner understand the concrete actions. See [authorization-spec.md](./authorization-spec.md#execution-plan-structure) |
| `--original-intent <text>` | -- | Raw user input that triggered this request. For single-turn: pass the user message verbatim. For multi-turn: concatenate all user messages directly related to this operation in order, formatted as `"User: <msg1>\nUser: <msg2>"`. Omit unrelated messages |

**Full spec mode (for advanced policy control):**

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--spec-file <path>` | Path to a JSON file containing the full authorization spec (permissions, policies, duration, completion conditions, resource scope, execution_plan). Mutually exclusive with `--spec-json` and inline flags (`--permissions`, `--duration`, `--max-tx`, `--resource-scope`). |
| `--spec-json <json>` | Inline JSON string containing the full authorization spec. Mutually exclusive with `--spec-file` and inline flags. |

Use `--spec-file` or `--spec-json` when you need custom policies (allow/deny pairs, chain/token/contract scoping, rolling usage limits). See [authorization-spec.md](./authorization-spec.md#policy-construction-patterns) for policy schema and construction patterns.

**Other flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--wait` | `false` | Block until the authorization leaves `pending_approval` |
| `--wait-timeout` | `10m` | Timeout for `--wait` |

**Status tracking (pact submit only):** Include `prompt` in `--context` when submitting, then run `caw track --watch &` in the background. The prompt is read from the saved context — **this prompt applies to `caw pact submit` only.** If there is no relevant context, no follow-up is needed. Use: `--context '{"channel":"<channel>", "target":"<target>", "session_id":<session_id>, "prompt":"notify the user of the status update first, then execute the next steps based on the conversation context if applicable. Prefix the response with [Notification] to distinguish it from normal conversation replies"}'`

**Example (inline mode):**

```bash
caw --format json pact submit \
  --wallet-id a1b2c3d4-5678-9abc-def0-123456789abc \
  --intent "Execute weekly ETH DCA on Base for 3 months" \

```

### `caw pact get <pact-id>`

Get details of a specific authorization request. When the request is `pending_approval` and the linked approval has been resolved, this endpoint triggers lazy activation or rejection.

- If approved → returns `status: active` with `api_key`, `delegation_id`, `expires_at`
- If rejected → returns `status: rejected`

The `api_key` field is only visible to the operator principal that submitted the request.

```bash
caw --format json pact get <pact_id>
```

### `caw pact list`

List pacts accessible to the authenticated principal.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--status <status>` | — | Filter by lifecycle state: `pending_approval`, `active`, `rejected`, `completed`, `expired`, `cancelled` |
| `--wallet-id <uuid>` | — | Filter by wallet UUID |
| `--limit <n>` | `50` | Maximum results (1–200) |
| `--offset <n>` | `0` | Number of results to skip |

```bash
# List all pending pacts for a specific wallet
caw --format json pact list --status pending_approval --wallet-id <wallet_uuid>

# List all active pacts
caw --format json pact list --status active
```

### `caw pact events <pact-id>`

Get the lifecycle event history for an authorization request. Useful for tracking state transitions, activation timestamps, and completion/revocation reasons.

```bash
caw --format json pact events <pact_id>
```

### `caw pact cancel <pact-id>`

Cancel an active authorization. **Owner only.** Cancelling revokes the associated delegation, invalidates the authorization-scoped API key, and records a `cancelled` event. This action cannot be undone.

Prompts for confirmation by default. Use `--yes` to skip.

```bash
caw --format json pact cancel <pact_id>
```

## Least Privilege Principle

Every authorization request MUST use the minimum access needed for the task. Over-scoped requests increase risk and may be rejected by the owner.

**Permissions**: Choose the narrowest set:

| Task type | Permissions | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only monitoring (balance alerts, portfolio tracking) | `viewer` (expands to `read:wallet`) | No writes needed |
| Token transfers only (payroll, invoice payments) | `read:wallet`, `write:transfer` | No contract calls needed |
| Contract calls only (DeFi swaps, staking) | `read:wallet`, `write:contract_call` | No direct transfers needed |
| Both transfers and contract calls | `operator` (shorthand) | Only when both are genuinely needed |

**Policies**: Scope as tightly as possible:

- Restrict `chain_in` to only the chains involved (e.g. `["BASE"]`, not all chains)
- Restrict `token_in` to specific tokens the task uses (e.g. `[{"chain_id":"BASE","token_id":"USDC"}]`)
- Restrict `target_in` to specific contract addresses (e.g. Uniswap V3 router only)
- Set `deny_if.amount_usd_gt` to the maximum acceptable per-transaction value
- Set `deny_if.usage_limits` rolling windows to cap cumulative spend
- Use `review_if` for amounts that should trigger owner review but not block outright

**Duration and completion**: Always set finite bounds:

- Set `--duration` to the shortest time window that covers the task
- Set completion conditions (`tx_count`, `amount_spent_usd`) when the total scope is bounded
- Avoid `0` duration (no expiry) unless the user explicitly requests indefinite access

**Resource scope**: Always bind to the target wallet via `--resource-scope '{"wallet_id":"<uuid>"}'`.

## Intent -> Submit Parameter Mapping

When user intent is fully understood and execution is ready, construct submit arguments:

| Intent component | Flag | Mapping guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Target wallet | `--wallet-id` | Exact wallet UUID |
| Goal description | `--intent` | Normalized goal including asset/protocol/chain/cadence and key risk constraints |
| Operation scope | `--permissions` | Least privilege set (see [Least Privilege](#least-privilege-principle)). Default `operator` only if both transfers and contract calls are needed |
| Time window | `--duration` | Parse explicit time: `30d` -> `2592000`, `3 months` -> `7776000`. Prefer finite duration. |
| Per-transaction budget | `--max-tx` | Per-transaction USD cap if user provided budget constraints (inline policy shortcut) |
| Custom policies | `--spec-file` / `--spec-json` | Use when the task needs chain/token/contract scoping, allow/deny pairs, or rolling usage limits. See [authorization-spec.md](./authorization-spec.md#policy-construction-patterns) for patterns. |
| Display name | `--name` | Concise title for owner approval review |
| Resource binding | `--resource-scope` | JSON scope constraints; always bind to wallet |
| Execution plan | `--execution-plan` | Free-form markdown with `# Summary`, `# Contract Operations`, `# Risk Controls`, `# Schedule` sections. Helps owner make informed approval decision |
| Raw user input | `--original-intent` | Pass user's original message(s) verbatim. Single-turn: the triggering message. Multi-turn: concatenate all messages relevant to this operation in order as `"User: <msg1>\nUser: <msg2>"`. Skip unrelated turns |

**Choosing inline vs. full spec:**

| Scenario | Approach |
|---|---|
| Simple budget cap only (max USD per tx) | Use `--max-tx` inline flag |
| Needs chain/token/contract restrictions, rolling limits, or allow+deny pairs | Use `--spec-file` or `--spec-json` with full policies array |
| Complex multi-policy setup with completion conditions | Use `--spec-file` pointing to a JSON file for readability |

**Example mapping:**

> User: "DCA $500/week into ETH on Base for 3 months, max $550 per swap"

```bash
caw --format json pact submit \
  --wallet-id <uuid> \
  --intent "DCA $500/week into ETH on Base for 3 months, max $550 per swap" \
  --permissions write:contract_call,read:wallet \
  --duration 7776000 \
  --max-tx 550 \
  --name "Base ETH Weekly DCA" \
  --resource-scope '{"wallet_id":"<uuid>"}' \
  --context '{"channel":"<channel>", "target":"<target>", "session_id":12345, "prompt":"notify the user of the status update first, then execute the next steps based on the conversation context if applicable. Prefix the response with [Notification] to distinguish it from normal conversation replies"}' \
  && caw track --watch &
```

Note: `--permissions` uses `write:contract_call,read:wallet` instead of the broader `operator` since DCA swaps only need contract calls, not direct transfers.

## Submission Rules

If delegated execution is required and intent is complete, submit an authorization request immediately before execution.

**Readiness checklist before submit:**

- [ ] Wallet target is explicit (user confirmed or only one wallet available)
- [ ] No duplicate pending request for this wallet (dedup check in [flow step 1](#execution-authorization-flow))
- [ ] Intent is specific and auditable (includes asset, action, chain, constraints)
- [ ] Permissions follow [least privilege](#least-privilege-principle) — only what the task requires
- [ ] Policies scope operations to specific chains, tokens, and/or contracts when applicable
- [ ] Duration is finite (or user explicitly confirmed unlimited)
- [ ] Budget constraints are explicit (per-tx via `--max-tx` or policies, cumulative via completion conditions)
- [ ] `--resource-scope` binds to the target wallet
- [ ] `--name` is concise and describes the task for owner review
- [ ] `--execution-plan` describes concrete actions for multi-step or non-obvious tasks
- [ ] `--original-intent` captures the user's raw input (single message or multi-turn concatenation)

**Do NOT submit if:**

- The user's intent is ambiguous — ask for clarification first
- The wallet target is unknown — query `caw --format json status` or ask the user
- The operation is a token transfer within default quota — try `caw tx transfer` directly first

## Post-Submission Flow

### Tracking Approval

After submit, the request enters `pending_approval`. Status changes are delivered automatically via `caw track --watch` running in the background. To manually check status:

```bash
caw --format json pact get <pact_id>
```

### Using the Authorization-Scoped API Key

When the request becomes `active`, the response includes an `api_key`. The operator uses this key for all subsequent operations under the authorization:

```bash
# Configure the authorization API key
caw profile set --api-key caw_sk_pact_abc123...

# Execute operations within authorization scope
caw --format json tx call --chain BASE --contract 0x... --calldata 0x...
```

All operations are checked against the delegation-scoped policies.

## Handling Outcomes

| Status | Agent action |
|---|---|
| `pending_approval` | Notify user that owner approval is required; share the review link `https://agenticwallet.sandbox.cobo.com/dashboard?approval=<approval_id>` (using `approval_id` from the submit response) so they can forward it to the owner; optionally poll periodically |
| `active` | Proceed with execution within authorization scope |
| `rejected` | Surface rejection to user; ask whether to adjust constraints and submit a new authorization request |
| `cancelled` / `expired` / `completed` | Stop execution; inform user; submit a new authorization request if continued action is needed |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `403` on submit | Agent not claimed by an owner, or not an AGENT principal | Run `caw onboard` and ensure the owner has claimed the agent |
| `404` on submit | Wallet not found or not owned by the agent's owner | Verify wallet UUID with `caw --format json status` |
| `422` on submit | Invalid authorization spec (policy rules, permissions, or completion conditions malformed) | Check [authorization-spec.md](./authorization-spec.md) for schema rules and validation constraints |
| Pact stuck in `pending_approval` | Owner hasn't reviewed in CAW App | Inform user that owner approval is pending |
| `api_key` not in response | Querying principal is not the submitting operator | Only the operator that submitted the request can see the API key |

For authorization spec construction details, policy schemas, and validation rules, see [authorization-spec.md](./authorization-spec.md).
